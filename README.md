## Introduction

Understanding public sentiment is crucial for businesses and organizations to gauge opinions on specific topics, brands, or campaigns. This project demonstrates how to analyze sentiment in social media data using Python, and how to visualize the results effectively.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is from Kaggle, titled ["Twitter Entity Sentiment Analysis"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jp797498e/twitter-entity-sentiment-analysis). It contains labeled Twitter data, where each tweet is associated with an entity and a sentiment score.

- **Dataset Features:**
  - `Tweet`: The text of the tweet.
  - `Entity`: The entity mentioned in the tweet (e.g., a brand, person, or topic).
  - `Sentiment`: The sentiment of the tweet towards the entity (e.g., Positive, Negative, Neutral).


  **Download the dataset:**

   Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jp797498e/twitter-entity-sentiment-analysis) and place it in the `data/` directory.

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**

   Open the `Task4.ipynb` file and run the cells in order to preprocess the data, analyze sentiment patterns, and visualize the results.

4. **Analyze the Results:**

   The notebook provides visualizations of sentiment distribution across entities, as well as time-series analysis of sentiment trends.

## Results

The sentiment analysis results are presented through various plots and graphs that help to understand the distribution of sentiments and the public's opinion on different entities. The key outputs include:

- **Sentiment Distribution**: Visualizing how sentiment is spread across different entities.
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Observing how sentiment towards an entity changes over time.
- **Word Clouds**: Displaying common words associated with each sentiment category.
